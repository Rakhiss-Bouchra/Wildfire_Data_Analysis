Wildfire Data collection & Analysis

## Data collection
The initial database in CSV format encompasses a variety of data points for each wildfire. 
Essential columns were selected by focusing on the wildfire's commencement date, the area burned in hectares, and latitude and longitude coordinates. 
High-resolution and current satellite images for specific geographic areas were gathered by utilizing these coordinates (latitude and longitude) through the Mapbox API. 
Regarding "non-wildfire" images, random coordinate pairs were generated for distinct Canadian urban regions, specifically Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Vancouver, and Calgary, all of which remained untouched by wildfires.

## Data analysis
Through the data visualization and analysis conducted on the CSV database, valuable patterns and trends were uncovered using various techniques in data visualization. The raw data was transformed into meaningful graphs, charts, and maps, providing a comprehensive understanding of wildfire incidents.
